<strong>WORK IN PROGRESS</strong>

A typeracer clone that aims to be less archaic and more feature-rich

## Planned features
 - provide support for very long quotes/text (multiple pages long)
 - format prose paragraphs and dialogue in a way that provides a good reading and typing experience
 - a clean, modern and customizable user interface
 - flexible, real-time multiplayer and skill-based matchmaking
 - "player aliases" - allowing users to create separate contexts within one account
 	- the player statistics for each alias are tracked separately
 - a ranking metric which aims to represent a player's skill by calculating a score, based on the difficulty and length of a quote/text, and the player's performance on that quote/text (inspired
   by the [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/FAQ) Performance Points system)
